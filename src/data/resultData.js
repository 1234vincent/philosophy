    { name: "Plato", 
    answer_ch: "你认为的自由似乎与柏拉图更为契合，他认为自由是在理性的统治下摆脱欲望的奴役，并且与自己的灵魂相契合。在这之后，才有可能实现真正的自由。你的回答显示你重视教育、秩序和理性，认为这些是通向自由的必要途径。对你而言，自由是掌控欲望、提升灵魂的过程。", 
    answer_en: "Your view of freedom aligns closely with Plato's philosophy. He believed that true freedom is not the license to do whatever one pleases, but the state of inner harmony achieved through the rule of reason. Based on your responses, you appear to value education, order, and rational control as essential to becoming free. For you, freedom means mastering desire and nurturing the soul." },
    { name: "Descartes",
    answer_ch: "你认为的自由似乎与笛卡尔更契合，他理解的自由是理性意思的表达，即使在欲望的驱动下也能做出理性的选择。你的回答显示你相信自由意志的存在，认为即使在欲望的驱动下，只要经过自我反思和意识的选择，依然可以是自由的。对你而言，自由是选择自己的能力和清晰的自我意识。", 
    answer_en: "Your understanding of freedom most closely resembles Descartes’. He saw freedom as the expression of rational will—the ability to choose knowingly, even when faced with internal desires. Your answers suggest that you believe in the power of self-reflection, and that even desire-driven decisions can be free if they come from conscious deliberation. To you, freedom lies in the clarity and awareness of choosing for yourself."},
   { name: "Kant", 
    answer_ch: "你认为的自由或许与康德的更加契合，他理解的自由是自律，是在理性道德法则下的自主行为。你的回答显示你拒绝单纯的伤害他人或追求快乐来定义自由。对你而言，自由是责任、自律和尊重他人道德价值的体现。", 
    answer_en: "Your responses reflect a strong alignment with Kant’s conception of freedom. He believed that true freedom is self-governance—acting not on impulse, but according to moral principles that could be universally applied. You tend to reject the idea that pleasure or personal gain alone defines freedom. For you, freedom is about moral responsibility, inner discipline, and a deep respect for the rights of others."},

    { name: "Beauvoir",
    answer_ch: "你认为的自由似乎与波伏娃更为契合，她认为是在具体处境下做出的选择，并愿意为此承担后果。你的回答显示你重视个人选择和对他人自由的尊重，认为自由不仅是个人的选择，也是对他人选择的尊重。对你而言，自由是选择、责任和对他人自由的尊重。",
    answer_en: "Your view of freedom resonates deeply with Simone de Beauvoir’s philosophy. She believed that freedom is always situated—it arises when we make choices in real contexts and fully accept the responsibility they entail. Your responses suggest that you value personal agency and acknowledge that freedom must include respect for others’ choices as well. To you, freedom means choosing authentically and recognizing that your freedom exists alongside the freedom of others." }
