    { name: "Plato", 
    answer_ch: "你对自由的理解更接近柏拉图的思想。他认为自由不是随心所欲，而是灵魂内部各部分在理性引导下的和谐秩序。在你的回答中，你倾向于相信教育、理性和社会秩序是通往真正自由的关键。对你来说，自由意味着克制欲望、追求智慧，最终达到灵魂的平衡。", 
    answer_en: "Your view of freedom aligns closely with Plato's philosophy. He believed that true freedom is not doing whatever one wants, but achieving inner harmony through the guidance of reason. Based on your responses, you value education, order, and rationality as necessary paths to freedom. To you, freedom is about mastering desire and elevating the soul.    " },
    { name: "Descartes",
    answer_ch: "你的自由观更贴近笛卡尔的思想。他主张自由源于思维的独立性，是人类理性选择的能力。你的回答显示你倾向于认为即使被欲望驱动，只要经过理性反思，这种选择依然是自由的表达。你相信，自由意志的核心在于我们能否意识到自己为何而选、如何而行。", 
    answer_en: "Your understanding of freedom is most similar to Descartes’. He emphasized that freedom stems from the independence of thought and the capacity for rational choice. Your answers suggest that you believe even desire-driven decisions can be free, so long as they follow self-awareness and reflection. To you, free will lies in the clarity of choosing for oneself." },
    { name: "Kant", 
    answer_ch: "你的回答显示你最接近康德的自由观。他认为真正的自由必须建立在道德法则之上，是一种“自律”——服从理性所制定的普遍规则。你倾向于拒绝将伤害他人的决定视为自由，也不认为快乐是自由的终极目标。对你来说，自由意味着责任、自我约束，以及对他人权利的尊重。", 
    answer_en: "Your answers resonate most with Kant’s view of freedom. He believed that true freedom is moral autonomy—acting according to self-imposed rational laws. You tend to reject the idea that harming others or pursuing pleasure alone can define freedom. For you, freedom is about responsibility, self-discipline, and respect for the moral worth of others."},
